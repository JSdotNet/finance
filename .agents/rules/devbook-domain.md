# Domain documentation (`domain/`)

`domain/` is the durable, ubiquitous-language record of the domain model,
organized by bounded context. It is the authoritative source for "what the
domain looks like" — complementary to `arc42/` (system architecture), `tech/`
(technology stack), and `design/` (UX guidelines).

## Context-loading policy

- `domain/` is **not** baseline repository context. Load it only for domain
  modeling, bounded-context, or ubiquitous-language tasks, normally after
  routing through the repository's domain flow or a domain specialist
  agent.
- When `domain/` is needed as task context, load only the relevant bounded
  context's chapters instead of reading the whole folder by default.
- Implementation work consults `domain/` when the change touches domain
  behavior, an aggregate boundary, or naming — not by default.

## Structure

`domain/` contains one root strategic artifact plus one folder per bounded
context.

Each bounded context gets its own subfolder, named in kebab-case after the
context (e.g. `.devbook/domain/order-management/`). Use the same name consistently
across `domain/`, ADRs, and code module names where practical.

```
.devbook/domain/
  context-map.md
  <bounded-context-name>/
    context.md       # the boundary: what the context is responsible for, its
                     # feature flags and settings, and — until they outgrow
                     # it — its actors and its dependencies
    domain.md
    actors.md        # optional: the actors, once context.md is too small
                     # for them
    features.md      # what the context lets a user do, in business language
    skills.md        # the alternative to features.md, for a repository whose
                     # product is procedures rather than a running application
    model.md
    flow.md          # optional: when the context has lifecycle/process flows
    dependencies.md  # optional: the dependencies, once context.md is too
                     # small for them
    domain.<name>.md    # optional: one chapter split out of the file it is
    features.<name>.md  #   named after — an aggregate or domain service, a
    skills.<name>.md    #   feature, a skill, one aggregate's structure, one
    model.<name>.md     #   flow — when it is large enough or read often
    flow.<name>.md      #   enough to stand alone. See "A split file" below.
```

When starting a new bounded context, create the folder with `context.md`,
`domain.md`, `model.md`, and one of `features.md` or `skills.md`, using the
templates below. Add `flow.md` when the context has lifecycle or process
flows, and split `actors.md` or `dependencies.md` out of `context.md` only
when it has grown past what one file reads well with.

**`context.md` is the boundary, and the context's root document.** It opens
with what the context is responsible for — inside the boundary, outside it,
and where the outside is answered — as prose under the file-level block, with
no chapter of its own. After that come the chapters that describe the context
as a whole rather than its model: the feature flags its capabilities are
switched by, the settings a person chooses, its actors, and its dependencies. A reader
arrives here first and leaves with the shape of the context before opening
`domain.md`, which is the model and nothing else.

**A kind lives in its own file or in `context.md`, never both.** Actor
chapters (`user`, `organisation`, `technical`) sit in `context.md` until the
context has enough of them that the boundary file stops being about the
boundary; then all of them move to `actors.md`. The dependency tables sit
under one structural `## Dependencies` section in `context.md`, and move whole
to `dependencies.md` the same way. A chapter's type says what it is wherever
it sits, so a move changes addresses and nothing else; a context with an actor
in each place has split one answer across two files, exactly as one holding
both `features.md` and `skills.md` has.

**A flag is decided at release; a setting is decided by a person.** A
`feature-flag` chapter is a switch decided at release, from configuration: the
team turns it on for an environment, a ring, or everyone, and retires it once
the capability is simply there. A `setting` chapter is a value a person
chooses at runtime — a user for themselves, an administrator for a tenant, an
operator for the system, which is what its `scope` records. Whether that value
turns a capability on or shapes how it behaves is not a second kind: a setting
that enables a feature is a setting whose values are `on` and `off`, and the
feature chapter's `setting` reference is what says the capability hangs on it.
Both carry `key`, the identifier as the code spells it, which is what lets a
flag check or a configuration read found in code resolve to a chapter instead
of to prose. A feature points at what gates or configures it through
`feature-flag` or `setting`.

**A context takes `features.md` or `skills.md`, never both.** They answer the
same question — what does this context let someone do — for two different kinds
of repository, so a context holding both has split one answer across two files.
Pick per context, not per repository, though in practice a repository lands on
one of them throughout.

**The actor chapters say who; the rest of the context says what.** No other
chapter states which role the someone in "the case worker files a request" is.
They are that record — in `context.md`, or in `actors.md` once they have
outgrown it: one flat `##` chapter per actor, headed by its name alone,
with `type` carrying which of three kinds it is. A `user` is a person with an
account who operates the context — it needs a right, and it issues the actions
the feature chapters describe. An `organisation` is a person or body the context
acts toward or models without operating it: a creditor answering a request, a
bank receiving a file, a judge whose ruling unblocks a case. A `technical` actor
is a system or timer that triggers a use case from outside — a scheduler that
closes the month, an inbound callback, the system account an audit trail records.
Users first, then organisations, then technical actors, with no grouping headings
— `type` already says which is which. Generalisation ("every Consultant is an
Employee") is a sentence in the first beat, never a nested chapter.

A `user` chapter carries `role`: the role, claim, or group name as the
authorization layer spells it, a string or a list. It is what lets a role check
found in code resolve to the actor that holds it instead of to prose. Omit it
where it has no value; an `organisation` or `technical` chapter rarely has one.

An actor is the EventStorming and Domain Storytelling actor — the one that issues
a command — and deliberately not a persona. A persona is a UX archetype of goals
and frustrations, is not ubiquitous language, and belongs in `design/` where a
repository wants one. Nor is a `technical` actor the actor-model kind: a mailbox
object, grain, or process is an implementation building block and belongs in
`arc42/`. A context nobody works with directly — a library, or one reached only
by another context — omits the file, and its absence is not a missing file.

**The ubiquitous language is the model, so it lives on the model.** A term that
is already a chapter — an aggregate, an entity, a value object, an enum, a
domain service, a domain event, an actor — carries its surface names in that
chapter's `aliases` field and earns no second chapter. Only a term with no
chapter to sit on — a role word, a process word, a name a consumer uses for
something this context never models as a thing — becomes a `term` chapter, under
the `## Ubiquitous Language` grouping at the end of `domain.md`. There is no
separate glossary file: a registry that names what the model already names is a
second copy, and it goes stale on the side nobody reads.

**A split file holds one chapter of the file it is named after.** `domain.md`,
`features.md` or `skills.md`, `model.md`, and `flow.md` each split the same way:
`<file>.<name>.md`, where the suffix is the kebab-case name of the one thing the
file holds — `domain.order.md` is the `## Order` aggregate with everything it
owns, `features.checkout.md` one feature with its sub-features, `model.order.md`
one aggregate's structure, `flow.flow-code.md` one flow, named after the skill it
belongs to. A split file carries the `type` of the file it came from, because it
is the same kind of document at a smaller scope, and its chapter reads exactly as
it did inside that file: same heading, same block, same sub-chapters. Split when
the file stops being readable, or when readers arrive looking for one chapter
rather than for the context; keep the base file for the chapters still better
read together. `features.md`, `skills.md`, `model.md`, and `flow.md` may be
dropped once every chapter is split out; `domain.md` never is, because it holds
what belongs to no single aggregate — the `## Shared Value Objects`,
`## Shared Enums`, and `## Ubiquitous Language` groupings — and `context.md`
does not split at all, because it is the root document and what it holds is
small by construction. A split chapter moves rather than copies: `## Order` lives at
`domain.order.md#order` and nowhere else in the context. Wherever a rule or a
skill names `domain.md`, `features.md`, `skills.md`, `model.md`, or `flow.md`,
it means that file or any split file of it.

Reading order comes from this convention, not from a metadata field and not from
filenames. `context-map.md` is `domain/`'s root document and is read first,
followed by the bounded contexts in alphabetical order; inside a context,
`context.md` is the root document and the rest read in the order listed in the
tree above — `domain.md`, `actors.md`, `skills.md` or `features.md`,
`model.md`, `flow.md`, `dependencies.md` — with a split file read directly
after the file it is named after, in filename order among its siblings, and in
that file's place when the file itself is gone.
Adding a context or a file needs no declaration anywhere; just regenerate
`_meta/`. See `devbook-chapter-metadata.md`.
## File responsibilities

- **context-map.md** — Strategic DDD view across bounded contexts at the
  `domain/` root.
  - Documents the subdomain landscape/classification (core/supporting/generic
    as applicable).
  - Captures bounded-context relationships in a context map.
  - Records published languages/contracts used across context boundaries.
  - States strategic rules that constrain cross-context collaboration.
- **context.md** — The bounded context as a whole: its boundary, its
  switches, and — until they outgrow it — its actors and dependencies. The
  context's root document.
  - Opens with the boundary: what the context is responsible for, what is
    inside it, what is outside it and where that is answered instead. Prose
    under the file-level block, no chapter of its own.
  - **`type: feature-flag`** — a capability switch decided at release, from
    configuration. Carries `key` (the flag key the code checks) and, where the
    catalog states one, `default: on` or `off`. The prose says who owns the
    rollout, what turning it on changes, and when the flag is retired.
  - **`type: setting`** — a value a person chooses at runtime, whether it
    turns a capability on or shapes how it behaves. Carries `key` (the setting
    key the code reads), `scope` (`user`, `tenant`, or `system` — who may
    change it), and `default`, the value the product ships with. The prose
    says what each value does.
  - Both are headed by their name in business language, never the key; the
    key is the field. Their `related` points at the feature chapters they gate
    or configure, and those chapters point back through `feature-flag` or
    `setting`.
  - The actor chapters, exactly as `actors.md` describes them, when the
    context keeps them here.
  - A structural `## Dependencies` section, last, holding the tables
    `dependencies.md` describes, when the context keeps them here. It carries
    no metadata block, like `flow.md`'s sections.
- **domain.md** — One chapter per Aggregate, Domain Service, Domain Event, or
  Shared Value Objects / Shared Enums grouping in the context.
  - Aggregate chapters include sub-chapters for their owned Entities, Value
    Objects, and Enums, each carrying its own metadata block.
  - Aggregate chapters also carry an `### Invariants` table — the rules the
    aggregate guarantees, one row per rule. See the folder rules below.
  - Domain Service chapters describe the service's responsibility and the
    aggregates/policies it coordinates.
  - Domain Event chapters are first-class addressable chapters and carry
    metadata blocks like other `domain.md` chapters.
  - Value Objects and Enums **shared across multiple aggregates** within the
    context get their own separate chapter — do not duplicate them under each
    aggregate that uses them.
- **actors.md** — Who works with this bounded context: one flat chapter per
  actor, headed by its name alone, with `type` carrying which of the three
  kinds it is. The chapters live in `context.md` until they outgrow it; this
  file exists only once they have moved, and then holds all of them.
  - **`type: user`** — a person with an account who operates the context.
    Four beats, in order, skipping any the context has no answer for: who it
    is, in one sentence, naming the term the screens use where it differs from
    the model term; what it does here, in business language, with `related`
    pointing at the feature chapters those actions live in; what the model holds
    it to, named only where the model actually records the role — a required
    field, an audit trail, a recorded submitter; and which right it needs, and
    where that right is configured. Its `role` field carries the name the
    authorization layer checks for that right.
  - **`type: organisation`** — a person or body the context acts toward or
    models without operating it. Three beats: who it is, what the context needs
    from it or does toward it, and how it appears in the model.
  - **`type: technical`** — a system or timer that triggers a use case from
    outside: a scheduler, an inbound callback, the system account. The same
    three beats: what it is, what it triggers here, and how the model records
    it. Its contract, where it has one, stays in the dependency tables.
  - A beat the repository cannot answer is left out and recorded as an
    `annotation` fence, never filled in with a plausible sentence. "Nobody has
    stated which right this needs" is information; an invented right is not.
  - Another bounded context or a module is a dependency and belongs in the
    dependency tables, never here. Name a bank, a portal, or a scheduler here
    only for what the context needs from it or what it triggers, and leave its
    contract to the tables. A tenant is not an actor either: it appears as the
    administrator user that changes settings.
  - Rights are stated here, not argued. Why a right is split — separation of
    duties, four eyes — is a modeling decision and belongs in `domain.md`, beside
    the invariant it protects.
    A context whose rights need a screen-to-right matrix closes the file with one
    `## Rights` section carrying that table.
- **features.md** — The features and sub-features this bounded context
  supports, in business language. Group sub-features under their parent
  feature.
- **skills.md** — The same question for a repository whose product is
  procedures rather than a running application: one chapter per skill the
  context ships, in the language of what the skill does for whoever runs it.
  A skill *is* a feature here, so its chapters carry `type: feature` and
  `type: sub-feature` like `features.md`'s — the file name says which kind of
  repository is being described, and the chapter type stays the same because
  the thing being described has not changed.
  - One chapter per skill, headed by the skill's own name, so the chapter is
    addressable by the name a user types.
  - Group a skill's own stages or modes under it as sub-chapters; do not give a
    stage a chapter of its own at `##` level.
  - Describe what the skill lets someone do and what it guarantees, not how it
    is implemented. Where it needs a diagram, that belongs in `flow.md` or in
    its own `flow.<skill-name>.md`.
- **model.md** — The structural domain model: relationships between
  aggregates, entities, and value objects, ideally as a Mermaid class diagram,
  plus relationship notes. Lifecycle/process flows live in `flow.md`, not
  here.
- **flow.md** — Lifecycle and process flows for the context (state machines,
  sequence diagrams, flowcharts) — how aggregates move through their states and
  how work moves across the context over time. Moved out of `model.md` so
  `model.md` stays purely structural. Include only when the context actually
  has a flow. Its `##` sections do not carry metadata blocks.
- **<file>.<name>.md** — One chapter split out of `domain.md`, `features.md`,
  `skills.md`, `model.md`, or `flow.md`, under the rules of that file: a
  `domain.<name>.md` chapter and its sub-chapters carry their blocks, a
  `model.<name>.md` or `flow.<name>.md` carries only the file-level one. Where
  a `flow.<name>.md` belongs to a skill, the file and that skill's chapter in
  `skills.md` are two halves of one subject — the chapter says what it does,
  the flow file draws how it moves — and each carries a `related` reference to
  the other.
- **dependencies.md** — Outbound dependencies on other bounded contexts or
  modules, and known inbound dependents. The tables live under
  `## Dependencies` in `context.md` until they outgrow it; this file exists
  only once they have moved.
  - Use explicit DDD relationship semantics (`ACL`, `Customer/Supplier`,
    `Partnership`, `OHS + Published Language`, etc.) instead of ad hoc
    integration prose.
  - For each relationship, document DDD pattern, integration mechanism,
    contract, and why/what the dependency relies on.
  - An actor chapter never restates one of these relationships: another

    bounded context or a module is a dependency, not an actor, and a

    `technical` actor is named there only for what it triggers. One file

    describes a relationship, so the two have no way of contradicting each

    other.


## Folder rules

These rules describe the persisted shape of `domain/` assets only. Authoring
workflow, routing, and cross-document governance are handled by separate
instructions.
- Every Aggregate, Domain Service, Domain Event, Shared Value Objects, and
  Shared Enums chapter in `domain.md`, every Entity/Value Object/Enum
  sub-chapter inside an Aggregate, every Feature/Sub-feature chapter in
  `features.md` or `skills.md`, every Feature Flag and Setting chapter in
  `context.md`, every User, Organisation, and Technical chapter in
  `context.md` or `actors.md`, and every Term chapter under `domain.md`'s
  `## Ubiquitous Language` grouping must carry a
  metadata block as described in
  `devbook-chapter-metadata.md`. `type` is required; `status` is
  optional here (see below); the optional cross-folder tags (`related`) and
  issue link (`issue`) are included only when they have a value.
- Every file in `domain/` — `context-map.md` and, per bounded context,
  `context.md`, `domain.md`, `actors.md` (when present), `features.md` or
  `skills.md`, `model.md`, `flow.md`, `dependencies.md` (when present), and
  each split file (when present) — must also carry the file-level metadata
  block described in `devbook-chapter-metadata.md`, placed directly under the
  file's top-level `#` heading. This applies even to `context-map.md`,
  `model.md`, `flow.md`, their split files, and
  `dependencies.md`, whose `##` sections do not carry their own per-chapter
  blocks — the file-level block is the only metadata those files carry.
  `context.md` declares `index: root`, so that it sorts first even in a
  context whose `domain.md` declared it before contract 11.
- The metadata block's `status` field uses `draft`, `proposed`, `active`, or
  `deprecated` in this folder. This folder describes the current (or
  agreed-future) model, not a task queue, so there is no `done`: `active`
  means "this is the current model", `deprecated` means superseded.
- On top of that ladder sits the shared `approved` rung, defined once in
  `devbook-chapter-metadata.md`: a person approved this chapter,
  recorded with `approved-by` and `approved-at`. It is written explicitly, never
  rested at, and comes off the moment the content changes.
- **`active` is this folder's resting value, so it is written by omitting the
  field.** State `status` only while the chapter is in transition (`draft`,
  `proposed`) or carries a standing warning (`deprecated`); drop the line when
  it settles. Most of a mature bounded context is the current model, and
  restating that on every chapter says nothing while hiding the few chapters
  that are genuinely moving. Writing `status: active` explicitly is reported.
- The metadata block's `type` field records what kind of thing the chapter or
  file is — the classification that is **never** written into the heading. This
  folder's value sets are:

  | Level | Values |
  |---|---|
  | Chapter | `aggregate`, `entity`, `value-object`, `enum`, `shared-value-objects`, `shared-enums`, `ubiquitous-language`, `domain-service`, `domain-event`, `feature`, `sub-feature`, `feature-flag`, `setting`, `user`, `organisation`, `technical`, `term` |
  | File | `context-map`, `context`, `domain`, `actors`, `features`, `skills`, `model`, `flow`, `dependencies` |

  There is no `skill` chapter type, deliberately. A skill in `skills.md` is a
  `feature` and its stages are `sub-feature`s: the file already says which kind
  of repository is being described, and a second vocabulary for the same
  relationship would make every consumer of the graph branch on the filename to
  learn nothing.

  Each file's `type` matches its filename: `context.md` is `type: context`,
  `domain.md` is `type: domain`, `features.md` is `type: features`, and so on,
  with `context-map.md` at the `domain/` root carrying `type: context-map`. A
  split file carries the type of the file it is named after — `domain.order.md`
  is `type: domain` — because the suffix narrows the scope and not the kind.
- Heading text in `domain/` carries the **name only** — `## Order`, not
  `## Aggregate: Order`. Anchors are therefore slugs of the bare name
  (`.domain/order-management/domain.md#order`). The two exceptions are the
  `## Shared Value Objects` and `## Shared Enums` chapters, whose headings name
  a grouping rather than a single thing, so the descriptive text *is* the name.
  `## Ubiquitous Language` is a third of the same kind.
  File titles are the bounded-context name alone (`# Order Management`), with
  the file's own `type` distinguishing the files of a context. A split file is
  no exception: its title stays the context name and the chapter's own name
  goes in its `##` heading, exactly as it did inside the file it came from.

  `context-map.md` is the one `domain/` file that is not about a single bounded
  context, so it has no context name to carry. Prefer titling it after the
  system or product the map covers — `# Order Platform` — with
  `type: context-map` carrying the kind, exactly as everywhere else. The
  generator composes its node label as `Order Platform (context-map)`, so the kind
  stays visible in the graph and the label stays distinct when several
  repositories' devbook folders are viewed together.

  A plain `# Context Map` is also accepted, and the generator suppresses the
  redundant suffix so it renders as `Context Map` rather than
  `Context Map (context-map)`. It restates the `type` in the heading, which is
  mildly against the grain of this convention, but it reads unambiguously and
  reasonable people prefer it. Pick one per repository and stay with it; do not
  churn an existing title to switch.

  A `domain/` folder written the old way (kind prefixes in headings, no `type`,
  `#### <Name>` sub-chapters under `### Entities`) is migrated with the steps in
  the devbook plugin README under "Migrating to schema version 2".
- `features.md` and `skills.md` Feature/Sub-feature chapters may carry an
  additional `depends-on` field: a list of `<path>#<heading-slug>` references (see
  `devbook-chapter-metadata.md` for the reference
  format) to other features that must be delivered first, e.g.
  `depends-on: [.devbook/domain/order-management/features.md#refunds]`.
  `domain.md` chapters (Aggregates, Domain Services, Domain Events, Shared
  Value Objects/Enums) do not use `depends-on` — they describe standing
  structure, and their relationships belong in `model.md`, the dependency
  tables, or the `related` field instead.
- `features.md` and `skills.md` Feature/Sub-feature chapters may carry a
  `feature-flag` field and a `setting` field: `<path>#<heading-slug>`
  references to the `feature-flag` chapters that gate this capability and the
  `setting` chapters that gate or configure it, in the context's `context.md`,
  e.g.
  `feature-flag: .devbook/domain/inbox/context.md#inbox-pane` or, when several
  together deliver one chapter,
  `feature-flag: [.devbook/domain/inbox/context.md#inbox-pane, .devbook/domain/inbox/context.md#inbox-filters]`.
  One flag or setting may equally be pointed at by several chapters. A
  `feature-flag` reference produces a `gated-by` edge, a `setting` reference a
  `configured-by` edge, and each must resolve to a chapter of the matching
  type — a `feature-flag` reference to an aggregate is an error. Omit either
  field when the chapter has nothing to point at. `domain.md` chapters and
  `term` chapters use neither: a flag or a setting belongs to a capability,
  not to a structural element or a term.

  Before contract 11 `feature-flag` held the bare application key, because the
  flag's catalog lived outside the repository. The catalog is `context.md` now;
  the key sits on the switch's own chapter, and a bare key in the field is an
  error that names the `011-context-md` migration.

  Either link is an **identity** link only — it says "this chapter and that
  switch are the same capability". It is deliberately **not** a status mapping.
  The `status` values above describe how settled the written model is; a
  flag's rollout or a setting's default describes whether the running behaviour
  can be relied on. Those answer different questions, so do not translate one
  vocabulary into the other, and do not infer a chapter's `status` from its
  switch or the reverse.
- `context.md` Feature Flag and Setting chapters carry `key`: the identifier
  as the code spells it, a single plain string — `key: checkout.express` — and
  never a reference. It is what a flag check or a configuration read found in
  code resolves to, so a switch chapter without one is an error. Both may
  carry `default`: `on` or `off` for a flag, the shipped value for a setting.
  A Setting chapter also carries `scope`, one of `user`, `tenant`, `system` —
  who may change it at runtime. A flag has no `scope`: it is decided at
  release, and writing one on it is an error. No other chapter carries any of
  the three.
- Actor chapters may carry a `role` field: the role, claim, or group name
  the authorization layer checks for this actor, as the code spells it — e.g.
  `role: Consultant` or, where one actor holds several, `role: [Consultant,
  TeamLead]`. Like `key`, entries are plain application identifiers,
  not `<path>#<heading-slug>` references: the name lives in the repository's
  authorization configuration, so the field produces no graph edge and the value
  is never validated here. It is the fourth beat made addressable — a role check
  found in code resolves to the `user` whose `role` matches. Omit it when the
  actor has none, which is the usual case for `organisation` and `technical`;
  no other chapter type carries it. `role` here is the RBAC role a right is
  granted to, never the role a domain object plays in a relationship — that is
  modelled in `domain.md`.
- In the dependency tables — under `## Dependencies` in `context.md` or in
  `dependencies.md` — use explicit DDD relationship terminology for each
  cross-context row when applicable (for example: `ACL`,
  `Customer/Supplier`, `Partnership`, `OHS + Published Language`) and identify
  the contract/published language entry used by consumers.
- Every Aggregate chapter in `domain.md` carries an `### Invariants`
  sub-section directly under its prose: a table with one row per rule the
  aggregate guarantees. It is a structural sub-section of that one chapter, not
  an addressable chapter, so it carries no metadata block — like `### Payload`
  under a Domain Event. Entity and Value Object sub-chapters may carry the same
  table when they enforce rules of their own; where they do not, their prose
  validation rules are enough and the aggregate's table is the record.

  | Column | Holds |
  |---|---|
  | `Rule` | One rule, in the domain's own language, stated as a claim that is either true or false. One rule per row — a row holding three related rules cannot be checked, enforced, or accepted as one thing. |
  | `Enforced at` | Where the aggregate guarantees it: `constructor`, a named transition (`Confirm()`, `AddLine()`), or `all mutations` when it genuinely holds across every one. |
  | `Evidence` | What establishes that it holds: a selector from the chapter's `tests` field, or `untested` when a guard clause enforces the rule and no test asserts it. |

  `Enforced at` is the column that prose loses. An invariant is what the type
  guarantees no matter who calls it, and *where* it is guaranteed is what tells
  an `apply-change` pass whether a guard clause belongs in the constructor or in one
  transition. A rule whose enforcement point cannot be named is usually a
  caller's rule rather than an invariant — see `assets/code-sync-protocol.md`.

  `untested` is a real and useful state: write it rather than leaving the cell
  empty. An empty cell reads as "not filled in yet", which is a different claim,
  and a rule nothing asserts is one refactor away from being gone.
- A rule that is **not yet settled** is recorded in the same table as a row with
  `open` in `Enforced at` and the open question itself in `Evidence`. This is
  the hot spot of an Event Storming session kept in place rather than resolved
  by guessing, and it is where `assets/code-sync-protocol.md` means a rule to go
  when it says to record it as an open question instead of capturing it as fact.

  An `open` row does not stop a chapter reaching `active` — a model can
  be the current one and still carry a known unanswered question. It does stop
  that one rule being *built*: an `apply-change` pass names it as needing a decision
  instead of briefing an implementation of a rule nobody has agreed.
- In Domain Service chapters, state invocation semantics when it clarifies
  behavior boundaries: whether logic is command-invoked, scheduled,
  query/composition-oriented, or event-triggered policy/process-manager
  behavior.
- Do not introduce a separate `policy.md` or a distinct `Policy` chapter type
  just to document process-manager behavior; keep that semantics in the
  relevant Domain Service chapter unless a separate structure is later decided
  explicitly.
- Any chapter may carry an `aliases` field: a list of plain-string surface
  names the thing is also known by — a code class or identifier name, a
  snake_case id field, a consumer context's local copy name, a host's own word
  for it. Unlike `related`/`depends-on`, `aliases` entries are plain strings,
  not `<path>#<heading-slug>` references. Omit the field when there are none;
  the file-level block may not carry it, like every other folder-specific
  field. This is how a modelled concept is its own glossary entry: the aggregate
  chapter `## Order` with `aliases: [OrderRoot, order_id]` is the term *Order*,
  and every synonym resolves to that one chapter. A `term` chapter exists only
  for a word that has no chapter to carry the field, and its `related` field
  points at the chapters it is about.

### context-map.md

```markdown
# <System or Product Name>

\`\`\`meta

> `domain/`'s root document. Prefer titling it after the system the map covers,

## Subdomain landscape

| Subdomain | Classification | Bounded context |
|---|---|---|
| <Subdomain> | Core / Supporting / Generic | <Bounded Context Name> |

## Context map

<Diagram or table of the relationships between bounded contexts, using
explicit DDD relationship terminology — ACL, Customer/Supplier, Partnership,
OHS + Published Language.>

## Published languages

<The contracts used across context boundaries, and which contexts consume
each one.>

## Strategic rules

<Rules that constrain cross-context collaboration.>
```

### context.md

```markdown
# <Bounded Context Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
index: root
type: context
\`\`\`

What this context is responsible for, in one or two sentences.

Inside the boundary: <the things this context owns and decides>.

Outside it: <what it deliberately does not own, and which context answers it
instead>.

## <Switch Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: feature-flag
key: <flag.key.as.the.code.checks.it>
default: off
related: [.devbook/domain/<context>/features.md#<heading-slug>]
\`\`\`

Decided at release, from configuration. Who owns the rollout, what turning it
on changes, and when the flag is retired.

## <Setting Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: setting
key: <setting.key.as.the.code.reads.it>
scope: user
default: <the shipped value>
related: [.devbook/domain/<context>/features.md#<heading-slug>]
\`\`\`

Chosen at runtime by whoever `scope` names. What each value does — whether it
turns the capability on or shapes how it behaves.

## <User Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: user
role: <RoleNameAsTheAuthorizationLayerSpellsIt>
related: [.devbook/domain/<context>/features.md#<heading-slug>]
\`\`\`

The actor chapters, exactly as in `actors.md` below, while the context keeps
them here.

## Dependencies

### Outbound dependencies

| Depends on (context/module) | DDD pattern | Integration mechanism | Contract | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <OtherContext> | <ACL / Customer-Supplier / Partnership / OHS + Published Language> | <event, API call, registry lookup, id link, etc.> | <published language / contract chapter reference> | <reason this context needs it> |

### Inbound dependents (known)

| Consumer (context/module) | DDD pattern | Integration mechanism | Contract | What it relies on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <OtherContext> | <ACL / Customer-Supplier / Partnership / OHS + Published Language> | <how the consumer integrates> | <published language / contract chapter reference> | <what would break if changed> |
```

`## Dependencies` is the file's one structural section: it carries no
metadata block, and it comes last. The tables are the ones `dependencies.md`
describes, one heading level down.

### domain.md

```markdown
# <Bounded Context Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: domain
\`\`\`

> One chapter per Aggregate, Domain Service, Domain Event, or Shared Value
> Objects / Shared Enums grouping in this bounded context.
> Aggregate chapters include sub-chapters for their owned Entities, Value
> Objects, and Enums. Value Objects/Enums shared across multiple aggregates
> get their own chapter at the end instead of being duplicated.

## <AggregateName>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: aggregate
\`\`\`

Responsibility, lifecycle, and why this aggregate exists as a consistency
boundary. The rules it guarantees go in the `### Invariants` table below rather
than in this prose.

### Invariants

| Rule | Enforced at | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| <One rule, as a claim that is either true or false> | <constructor / <Transition>() / all mutations / open> | <tests selector / untested / the open question> |

### <EntityName>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: entity
\`\`\`

Role within the aggregate, identity, and lifecycle notes.

### <ValueObjectName>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: value-object
\`\`\`

Meaning, equality semantics, and validation rules.

### <EnumName>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: enum
\`\`\`

Values and what each one means in business terms.

## <NextAggregateName>

...

## <DomainServiceName>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: domain-service
\`\`\`

Responsibility of the service, which aggregates/policies it coordinates, and
why the behavior does not belong on a single aggregate.

Invocation semantics: <command-invoked | scheduled |
query/composition-oriented | event-triggered policy/process manager>.

## <EventName>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: domain-event
\`\`\`

Published when <business trigger>.

### Payload

- `<field>` - <meaning and type/shape expectations>

### Consumers

- <Consumer context/service and why it consumes the event>

### Published language rules

- <contract stability and interpretation rules for consumers>

## Shared Value Objects

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: shared-value-objects
\`\`\`

> Value Objects used by more than one aggregate in this bounded context.

### <SharedValueObjectName>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: value-object
\`\`\`

Meaning, equality semantics, validation rules, and which aggregates use it.

## Shared Enums

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: shared-enums
\`\`\`

> Enums used by more than one aggregate in this bounded context.

### <SharedEnumName>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: enum
\`\`\`

Values and what each one means in business terms, and which aggregates use it.

## Ubiquitous Language

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: ubiquitous-language
\`\`\`

> The terms this context owns that are not chapters above. A term that is a
> chapter carries its aliases on that chapter instead. A grouping heading, so
> its descriptive text *is* its name; omit the grouping when there are none.

### <Canonical Term>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: term
aliases: [<AliasA>, <AliasB>]
related: [.devbook/domain/<context>/domain.md#<heading-slug>]
\`\`\`

Definition of the term and, where useful, when each alias appears.
```

The Entity, Value Object, and Enum sub-chapters sit directly under their
aggregate as `###` headings. There are no `### Entities` / `### Value Objects`
/ `### Enums` grouping headings — `type` already says which is which, and the
grouping headings only pushed every real chapter a level deeper and added
anchors nobody references.

`### Invariants` under an Aggregate, and `### Payload`, `### Consumers`, and
`### Published language rules` under a Domain Event, are structural
sub-sections of that one chapter rather than addressable chapters, so they carry
no metadata block. `build.mjs --check` warns on each of them, as it does on
every structural heading: the validator cannot know which headings a folder means
to be addressable, so the warning is expected here and never driven to zero.
`## Rights` in `actors.md` and `## Dependencies` in `context.md` are the same
case one level up — structural sections of the file rather than addressable
chapters — and warn the same way.

### actors.md

Only once the actor chapters have outgrown `context.md`; then every one of them
moves here.

```markdown
# <Bounded Context Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: actors
\`\`\`

> Who works with this bounded context: the users that operate it, the
> organisations it acts toward, and the technical actors that trigger it.
> Another bounded context or module is a dependency and belongs in the
> dependency tables, never here.

## <User Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: user
role: <RoleNameAsTheAuthorizationLayerSpellsIt>
related: [.devbook/domain/<context>/features.md#<heading-slug>]
\`\`\`

Who this user is, in one sentence, naming the term the screens use where it
differs from the model term.

What it does in this context, in business language, pointing at the feature
chapters those actions live in.

What the model holds it to: the required field, audit trail, or recorded
submitter where the model actually records the role.

Which right it needs, and where that right is configured.

## <Organisation Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: organisation
\`\`\`

Who this organisation is, what the context needs from it or does toward it,
and how it appears in the model.

## <Technical Actor Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: technical
related: [.devbook/domain/<context>/context.md#dependencies]
\`\`\`

What this actor is, what it triggers in this context, and how the model records
it. Its contract lives in the dependency tables.

## Rights

| Action | <User> | <User> |
|---|---|---|
| <what can be done> | <the right it needs, or —> | <the right it needs, or —> |
```

The `## Rights` section is present only where the context's rights want a matrix.
It is the file's one structural section: it carries no metadata block, and it
comes last.

### features.md

```markdown
# <Bounded Context Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: features
\`\`\`

> Features and sub-features this bounded context supports, described in
> business/ubiquitous language rather than implementation terms.

## <FeatureName>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: feature
feature-flag: [.devbook/domain/<context>/context.md#<switch-heading-slug>]
setting: [.devbook/domain/<context>/context.md#<setting-heading-slug>]
\`\`\`

Short description of the capability and the business value it delivers.

### <SubFeatureName>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: sub-feature
\`\`\`

Description of the sub-feature and how it fits under the parent feature.

### <NextSubFeatureName>

...

## <NextFeatureName>

...
```


### skills.md

The alternative to `features.md`, for a repository whose product is procedures.
A skill is a feature here, so the chapter types are the same.

```markdown
# <Bounded Context Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: skills
\`\`\`

> One chapter per skill this bounded context ships, described by what it lets
> someone do rather than by how it is implemented.

## <skill-name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: feature
related: [.devbook/domain/<context>/flow.<skill-name>.md]
\`\`\`

What the skill does for whoever runs it, what it guarantees, and where it
stops. Name the skill exactly as a user types it, so the anchor is the name.

### <Stage or Mode Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: sub-feature
\`\`\`

One stage of the skill, or one mode it can run in.

## <next-skill-name>

...
```

### model.md

```markdown
# <Bounded Context Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: model
\`\`\`

> Structural view of the domain model for this bounded context: aggregates,
> entities, value objects, and their relationships. Keep this in sync with
> `domain.md` (which describes responsibilities/invariants in prose) — this
> file focuses on structure and relationships.

## Model diagram

\`\`\`mermaid
classDiagram
    class AggregateName {
        +Identity Id

    }
    class EntityName
    class ValueObjectName

    AggregateName "1" --> "many" EntityName : contains
    AggregateName --> ValueObjectName : has
\`\`\`

## Relationship notes

- Describe cardinalities, ownership direction, and any relationships that
  aren't obvious from the diagram alone (e.g. why an association is one-way,
  or why two aggregates only relate by id reference rather than direct
  object reference).
```

### flow.md

```markdown
# <Bounded Context Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: flow
\`\`\`

> Lifecycle and process flows for this bounded context: how aggregates move
> through their states and how work moves across the context over time.
> Complementary to `model.md` (structure) and `domain.md`
> (responsibilities/invariants).

## <Flow Name>

\`\`\`mermaid
<mermaid state/sequence/flow diagram>
\`\`\`

- Optional notes: transitions, emitted events, and which state is persisted
  vs. which is a workflow-only phase.
```


### <file>.<name>.md

One chapter split out of its file, under that file's template: the file-level
block carries the base file's `type`, and the chapter follows as it stood there.
`domain.order.md` is the `## <AggregateName>` section of the `domain.md`
template under a `type: domain` file block; `features.checkout.md` and
`skills.<skill-name>.md` the same for one feature or skill; `model.order.md`
the `model.md` template narrowed to one aggregate. A `flow.<name>.md`:

```markdown
# <Bounded Context Name>

\`\`\`

> One flow: <what moves, and from where to where>. Structure is in

## <Flow Name>

<mermaid state/sequence/flow diagram>
\`\`\`

- Optional notes: transitions, emitted events, and which state is persisted
  vs. which is a workflow-only phase.
```

### dependencies.md

Only once the dependency tables have outgrown `context.md`'s `## Dependencies`
section; then the section moves here whole.

```markdown
# <Bounded Context Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
type: dependencies
\`\`\`

> Dependencies this bounded context has on other bounded contexts or
> modules, and known dependents. Use explicit DDD relationship semantics,
> integration mechanism details, and contract references.

## Outbound dependencies

| Depends on (context/module) | DDD pattern | Integration mechanism | Contract | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <OtherContext> | <ACL / Customer-Supplier / Partnership / OHS + Published Language> | <event, API call, registry lookup, id link, etc.> | <published language / contract chapter reference> | <reason this context needs it> |

## Inbound dependents (known)

| Consumer (context/module) | DDD pattern | Integration mechanism | Contract | What it relies on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <OtherContext> | <ACL / Customer-Supplier / Partnership / OHS + Published Language> | <how the consumer integrates> | <published language / contract chapter reference> | <what would break if changed> |

## Notes

- Prefer explicit DDD pattern names over free-text integration wording.
- Flag any dependency that crosses a bounded-context boundary without an
  anti-corruption layer or published language, so it can be revisited.
- Link to the relevant `domain-interaction-diagram` / `context-mapping`
  artifact if one exists for this relationship, instead of duplicating it.
