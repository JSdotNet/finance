# Architecture documentation (`arc42/`)

`arc42/` holds arc42-structured architecture documentation for the system:
context, building blocks, runtime views, cross-cutting concerns, and
architecture decisions, at the level of the whole system or a major
deployable unit.

## Context-loading policy

- `arc42/` is **not** baseline repository context. Load it only for architecture,
  ADR, blueprint, TDR, or explicit arc42 tasks, normally after routing through the
  repository's architecture flow or an architecture specialist agent.
- When `arc42/` is needed as task context, load only the relevant chapter(s) or
  sections instead of reading the whole folder by default.
- For non-architecture implementation or documentation tasks, consult `arc42/`
  only when the user asks for architecture context or when the work depends on a
  specific documented constraint, decision, runtime view, deployment view, or
  glossary entry.

## Relationship to other devbook folders

- `domain/` describes *what the domain is* (bounded contexts, aggregates,
  ubiquitous language). `arc42/` describes *how the system is built and runs*
  (containers, deployment, quality attributes, decisions).
- `design/` describes *how the product looks and behaves for the user* (UX
  principles, design tokens, interaction and accessibility rules). Channel and
  stack facts stay in `arc42/`; `design/` links to them.
- Decision records and debt records live under `arc42/adr/` and `arc42/tdr/`
  and are linked from `09-architecture-decisions.md` and
  `11-risks-and-technical-debt.md`, never restated there. A decision an
  organization already records elsewhere is linked, not copied.

## Structure

Use the standard arc42 chapter set as individual files (create files only
when a chapter has real content — do not scaffold empty placeholders):

```
.devbook/arc42/
  01-introduction-and-goals.md
  02-constraints.md
  03-context-and-scope.md
  04-solution-strategy.md
  05-building-block-view.md
  06-runtime-view.md
  07-deployment-view.md
  08-crosscutting-concepts.md
  09-architecture-decisions.md   (links out to ADRs, doesn't restate them)
  10-quality-requirements.md
  11-risks-and-technical-debt.md (links out to TDRs)
  12-glossary.md
  adr/                           (decision records — one per technical concern)
  tdr/                           (technical debt records — one per item)
```

## Folder rules

These rules describe the persisted shape of `arc42/` assets only. Authoring
workflow, routing, and cross-document governance are handled by separate
instructions.

- Keep the glossary aligned with the ubiquitous language defined per bounded
  context in `domain/`.
- Prefer diagrams (Mermaid) over long prose for building-block and runtime
  views.
- Each file's top-level chapter, and any independently trackable ## section
  inside it, must carry the metadata block described in
  `devbook-chapter-metadata.md` (status — optional here, see
  below — cross-folder tags, issue link) — required for the derived index and
  graph tooling. There is no `depends-on` field in `arc42/` —
  architecture chapters describe standing structure, not sequenced work;
  cross-references use `related` instead.
- Because an `arc42/` file is always exactly one top-level chapter, that
  chapter's metadata block also serves as the file's file-level metadata
  block described in `devbook-chapter-metadata.md`
  — do not add a second, duplicate block for the file.
- The metadata block's `status` field uses `draft`, `proposed`, `active`, or
  `deprecated` in this folder. Architecture documentation describes a
  standing decision/structure, not a task, so there is no `done`.
- On top of that ladder sits the shared `approved` rung, defined once in
  `devbook-chapter-metadata.md`: a person approved this chapter,
  recorded with `approved-by` and `approved-at`. It is written explicitly, never
  rested at, and comes off the moment the content changes.
- **`active` is this folder's resting value, so it is written by omitting the
  field.** State `status` only while the chapter is in transition (`draft`,
  `proposed`) or carries a standing warning (`deprecated`). A standing structure
  is settled by definition, so `active` is where nearly every chapter here ends
  up permanently, and stating it turns the field into noise the few moving
  chapters hide behind. Writing `status: active` explicitly is reported.
- **Chapters are ordered by their number, not by their filename string.** The
  `<NN>-` prefix supplies it, so `10-quality-requirements.md` sorts after
  `09-architecture-decisions.md` rather than after `01-…`. Only add an explicit
  `number` field when a file's name cannot carry the number.
- **Debt records are numbered with a date.** Number them in the filename
  (`7-no-retry-budget.md`) or, where the filename is a plain slug, in a
  `number` field — either way the number is what orders the folder, so an
  unpadded 10 still follows 7. Give each one a `date` for the day the debt was
  logged; it is content, not a modification timestamp. Decision records are not
  numbered; the next section says why.
- **Give `adr/` and `tdr/` an index document.** Neither folder has a root
  document by convention, so mark the one that introduces the set — usually
  `README.md` — with `index: root` and it sorts first. Without it the folder is
  a bare list.

## Decision records (`adr/`)

A decision record holds a **technical choice**: a storage engine, an API style,
a messaging or integration protocol, a hosting or deployment model, a runtime or
framework, how packages are managed and built. The test is what reversing it
would cost. A choice that would take a migration of code, data, or
infrastructure to reverse is a decision record; one a reader could reverse with
a find-and-replace is not. Naming, folder layout, process rules, who owns what,
and how a document is written are not architecture: the rule, chapter, or
bounded context that states them carries the reason in a sentence, and no
record is opened.

**One record per concern, not per decision.** The file is the concern —
`adr/storage.md`, `adr/api.md`, `adr/package-management.md` — a kebab-case slug
with no number, and it always describes the standing choice. A new decision on
a concern that already has a record changes that record: the choice is
rewritten, the reasons and rejected alternatives are brought in line, and a row
is added to its history. Open a new file only for a concern no record covers.
Two concerns that are always decided together are one record; a record that
keeps growing a second subject is two. A record for a concern the system no
longer has is marked `status: deprecated` and says what happened; it is never
deleted, because the history is the part a reader most needs.

Each record, in this order:

- The standing choice, in one or two sentences under the title, before any
  section.
- `## Why` — the reasons that carry it, as they stand today.
- `## Rejected` — each alternative considered and the reason it lost. Someone
  arriving to propose one of them should find it here.
- `## History` — a table, newest first, one row per decision: the date, what
  changed, and why in a clause. The bottom row is the concern's first choice.
  The `date` field carries the newest row's date; it is content, not a
  modification timestamp.

A proposed change to a concern lives in that record under `status: proposed`,
in a `## Proposed` section stating the candidate choice against the standing
one. Decided, it folds into the choice and a history row and the section goes;
declined, it becomes a history row saying so. A proposal never sits as a loose
document beside the set.

The `adr/` index lists every concern with its standing choice in one line, and
`09-architecture-decisions.md` links to the index and restates nothing.

```

`related` and `issue` are omitted above rather than written empty, per the
omit-when-empty rule; add them when they carry a value. Once a chapter settles,
its `status: draft` line comes out too and the fence is left empty — keep the
fence, it is what makes the heading an addressable chapter.
