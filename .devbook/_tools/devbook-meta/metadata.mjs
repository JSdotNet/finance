// as `meta`, one word different, placed in the body where the note belongs:
//
//     ```annotation
//     author: jobsc
//     date: 2026-09-02
//     body: Is this still true now the outline rollup is a view?
//     ```
//
// Writing a note as authored Markdown rather than as a row in the derived
// database is what makes `devbook.db` wholly derived again — position is the
// anchor, git is the sync and the backup, the pull request is the review, and
// `git blame` is the authorship record. None of that has to be built.
//
// The block grammar is richer than `meta`'s deliberately flat one: a thread
// needs a `body` that runs to a paragraph, an ordered `replies` list, and a
// nested `ext` mapping. So annotations get their own small indentation-aware
// reader below rather than bending `parseMetaBody`, which stays flat because
// every field it carries is a scalar or a bracket list.

// a record: `resolved` lives for the rest of the branch so a reviewer sees the
