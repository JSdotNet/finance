// repository authors and the derived artifacts a consumer reads. It moves only
// when something repo-visible changes shape, which is why a plugin release
// usually leaves it alone — and why the migration ledger keys off it.
//
// Version 11 adds `context.md` to `domain/` as a bounded context's root
// document, with `feature-flag` and `setting` chapters, and changes the shape
// of a feature's `feature-flag` field from a bare application key to a
// reference to one of those chapters — so it produces a `gated-by` edge now,
// beside the new `setting` field and its `configured-by` edge. A repository whose contexts have no
// `context.md`, or whose features still carry bare keys, stops validating, so
// `migrations/011-context-md/` writes the file and rewrites the keys.
// Version 10 removes `naming` from the `domain/` file types and with it the
// optional `naming.md`: a term that is a chapter carries its `aliases` on that
// chapter, and the rest are `term` chapters under `domain.md`'s
// `## Ubiquitous Language` grouping. A repository still carrying the file
// stops validating, so `migrations/010-terms-live-in-domain-md/` folds it in.
// Versions 8 and 9 were shipped by pre-1.0.0 migrations that no longer exist.
// Version 7 is additive over 6: the nested `.devbook/` layout is recognized
// alongside the flat dot-folders, and `bounded-context` joins the `.domain`
// chapter types so a context-map section can be addressed. Nothing that
// validated under 6 stops validating, so there is no migration folder.
// Version 6 removes `.backlog` from the recognized folders and with it the
// `implements` reference field, and adds two things on top of 5: the shared
// `approved` rung with its `approved-by`/`approved-at` record, and the opaque
// `ext` namespace an L1 plugin persists its own state in. Only the removal was
// breaking; its migration predates 1.0.0 and no longer ships. Version 5 was
// additive over 4: `status` may now be resolved from the folder's resting value
// rather than read off the block, and both artifacts gained an optional
// `statusDeclared: false` marking the entries where that happened. Version 4
// was additive over 3, adding the `tests` field carrying the
