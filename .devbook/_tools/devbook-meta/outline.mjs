// outline.mjs — derives the ordered reading outline of a devbook area from
// the folder convention, not from anything authored per repository.
//
// Markdown stays canonical; this produces the *derived* index that a viewer
// reads to present files in their intended order instead of alphabetically.
//
// Ordering rules, per directory:
//   1. The directory's *root document* sorts first — the file declaring
//      `index: root`, or failing that the entry point its folder convention
//      names (`.domain/context-map.md`, a bounded context's `domain.md`,
//      `.tech/technology-graph.md`, `.design/README.md`, `.ai/adoption-map.md`).
//   2. If anything left carries a **number** — from a `number` field or from a
//      numbered filename — the directory is a numbered set (arc42 chapters,
//      ADRs, TDRs, `.ai` usage files) and sorts by that number ascending, unnumbered entries
//      filename-sorted after them.
//   3. Otherwise the remaining prescribed files follow in the sequence that
//      folder's own instructions file documents in its structure block, with
//      anything else — an extra file, a bounded-context subdirectory, a
//      repository-chosen `.tech` layer — filename-sorted in between. A split
//      file (`domain.order.md`, one chapter out of `domain.md`) reads directly
//      after the file it is named after, in that file's place when the file
//      itself is gone.
//   4. A directory that is neither numbered nor covered by a convention sorts
//      by filename.
//
// A document declaring `index: exclude` is left out of the outline entirely.
//
// So reading order is a property of the *convention* by default and of the
// document itself where the document has something to say — its number, or that
// it is its directory's entry point. What it is never a property of is some
// other document's metadata block.
